Project 3 :  REST API CRUD application for F1 driver standings

In this project I have built a REST API i.e Representation State Transfer Application Programming Interface as a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) Application. I utilized Goâ€™s Gorilla Mux ( https://github.com/gorilla/mux ) framework which is a HTTP request multiplexer which is used for request routing and dispatching. I used Postman ( https://www.postman.com/ ) to simulate the frontend for my application. I have used the current F1 driver standings as data and built functions to get all driver standings, get driver standings by team and get driver standings by position through the local host server in Postman. I also built functions to create, update and delete a driver standing. All the data is encoded in json format and outputs are of the same format.
